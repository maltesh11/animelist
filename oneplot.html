    <p> One Piece is a Japanese manga series created by Eiichiro Oda, first serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1997. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate with a body made of rubber after eating the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit, as he sets out to find the legendary treasure "One Piece" and become the King of the Pirates. The series blends adventure, comedy, and deep worldbuilding, evolving into one of the most influential and best-selling manga of all time, with over 516 million copies in circulation as of 2022.

Luffy’s journey begins in Foosha Village in the East Blue, inspired by the legendary pirate Red-Haired Shanks, who gave him his iconic straw hat. After eating the Devil Fruit, Luffy loses the ability to swim but gains incredible elasticity and strength. At age 17, he sets sail alone in a rowboat, beginning his quest across the dangerous seas. </p>
